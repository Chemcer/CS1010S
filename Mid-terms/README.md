# General advice

## Cheatsheet

1 A4 size paper cheatsheet, try to be strategic and put in information that you struggle or might forget, also useful to include things like important string methods

## Code Tracing 

It is rather time consuming. If possible, notice which loops are "useless". Also take note of return None / question specifying code execution in shell.

## Code Reasoning 

Try to find for any edge cases. Can come in the form of index out of range, range(start, end that is smaller than start, step >= 1),...

## Code Debugging

Understand what the algorithm does. The information can be found in the question and can be inferred based on the code.

Afterwards, find the logical error and change it

## Writing code

Try not to forget syntax I guess. Don't break abstraction which will also bve mentioned in the question paper

# Solutions

I am quite lazy to make diagrams to accompany some questions, try to tun code on python tutor if you need more visualisation

If I think a certain answer key provided really in depth explanation, I will not be making a walkthrough for that
