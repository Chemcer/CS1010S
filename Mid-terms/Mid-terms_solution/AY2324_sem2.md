# Q1

## Part A, code tracing

Annoying thing about the question is that it wants Py shell output (which honestly, most of us don't even use)

```python
def print_return(n):
    print(n)
    return n

def fun(x, y):
    return print_return(print_return(4 + x) * print_return(2 ** y))

fun(print_return(2), print_return(3))
```

print_return(2) just prints and return 2, same thing for print_return(3)

fun(print_return(2), print_return(3)) --> prints 2 then 3 return those too --> fun(2, 3) --> print_return(print_return(4 + 2) * print_return(2 ** 3)) --> print_return(print_return(6) * print_return(8)) --> print 6 then 8 return those too --> print_return(48) --> print and return 48

```pycon
2
3
6
8
48
48
```

## Part B, flowchart to code

Notice that k cannot be 0 and n cannot be negative

The function subtracts k repeatedly until n < k, so it is like finding the remainder aka n%k

To convert the graph to code,

```python
def my_fun(n, k):
    if k == 0 or n < 0:
        return 'error'
    while n >= k:
        n -= k
    return n
```

## Part C

erm, follow the code and make sure for loop has a circle

# Q2 Logic operator

## Part A, AND gate

Refer to the question where positive is true and negative is false then translate the truth table to code. + AND + 1, the rest -1

```python
def b_and(a, b):
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return -1
```

## Part B, Ternary logic gates

Same idea as the previous

# Q3 Bar Charts

## Part A

Notice that the first row matches the leftmost number so the code must look something like `print('*' * int(data[0]))` then remove leftmost digit. So the code is 

```python
def print_hchart(data):
    if len(data) > 0:
        print("*" * int(data[0]))
        print_hchart(data[1:])
```

## Part B

If we convert this to a grid, the width is len(data) and the height is the largest digit in the number. We can use the helper function given in the question

Due to how python prints things out, we start from the very top row and work our way down. Using the given example as reference, the easiest way to ensure the * is printed correctly is to count downwards and check if row <= digit

The code is then

```python
def print_vchart(data):
    highest = largest(data)
    while highest != 0:
        row = ""
        for digit in data:
            row += "*" if highest <= int(digit) else " "
        print(row)
        highest -= 1
```

# Q4 Bingo

## Part A make card

The card must contain $n^2$ number of tiles and should be in the form tile 1 - tile 2 - tile 3 -...- tile n^2- and is a string. So the code is 

```python
def make_bingo_card(tiles, n):
    res = ""
    for i in range(n**2):
        res = res + get_tiles(i) + "-"
    return res
```

## Part B get first number

Unfortunately, while loop is rather annoying.



## Part C Remove first number



## Part D check number



## Part E output of function

The function is attempting to assign specific character in string to the letter X. Since strings are immutable (cannot be assigned), it will raise a type error
