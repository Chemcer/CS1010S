# Q1

## Part A, code tracing

Annoying thing about the question is that it wants Py shell output (which honestly, most of us don't even use)

```python
def print_return(n):
    print(n)
    return n

def fun(x, y):
    return print_return(print_return(4 + x) * print_return(2 ** y))

fun(print_return(2), print_return(3))
```

print_return(2) just prints and return 2, same thing for print_return(3)

fun(print_return(2), print_return(3)) --> prints 2 then 3 return those too --> fun(2, 3) --> print_return(print_return(4 + 2) * print_return(2 ** 3)) --> print_return(print_return(6) * print_return(8)) --> print 6 then 8 return those too --> print_return(48) --> print and return 48

```pycon
2
3
6
8
48
48
```

## Part B, flowchart to code

Notice that k cannot be 0 and n cannot be negative

The function subtracts k repeatedly until n < k, so it is like finding the remainder aka n%k

To convert the graph to code,

```python
def my_fun(n, k):
    if k == 0 or n < 0:
        return 'error'
    while n >= k:
        n -= k
    return n
```

## Part C

erm, follow the code and make sure for loop has a circle

# Q2 Logic operator

## Part A, AND gate

Refer to the question where positive is true and negative is false then translate the truth table to code. + AND + 1, the rest -1

```python
def b_and(a, b):
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return -1
```

## Part B, Ternary logic gates

Same idea as the previous

# Q3 Bar Charts

## Part A

Notice that the first row matches the leftmost number so the code must look something like `print('*' * int(data[0]))` then remove leftmost digit. So the code is 

```python
def print_hchart(data):
    if len(data) > 0:
        print("*" * int(data[0]))
        print_hchart(data[1:])
```

## Part B

If we convert this to a grid, the width is len(data) and the height is the largest digit in the number. We can use the helper function given in the question

Due to how python prints things out, we start from the very top row and work our way down. Using the given example as reference, the easiest way to ensure the * is printed correctly is to count downwards and check if row <= digit. 

<details>
    <summary><b> Iteration process </b></summary>

1st iteration (starting from highest value) , is the 1st digit same as the height? if yes * else space. Repeat that for subsequent digits. Once done, we "go down" the block for the next iteration, highest - 1

2nd iteration, saqme thing, is digit <= highest - 1?

Once we reach the "ground level", n = 1, same thing and end the loop

</details>

The code is then

```python
def print_vchart(data):
    highest = largest(data)
    while highest != 0:
        row = ""
        for digit in data:
            row += "*" if highest <= int(digit) else " "
        print(row)
        highest -= 1
```

# Q4 Bingo

## Part A make card

The card must contain $n^2$ number of tiles and should be in the form tile 1 - tile 2 - tile 3 -...- tile n^2- and is a string. So the code is 

```python
def make_bingo_card(tiles, n):
    res = ""
    for i in range(n**2):
        res = res + get_tiles(i) + "-"
    return res
```

## Part B get first number

Unfortunately, we are forced to use a while loop.

Since the card looks like (for example) '123-4-4-....', the first digit is before the first hyphen. Can either find the index of first hyphen then slice or concatenate the numbers and stop the loop when it reaches a hyphen

Conditions: character is not "-" and of course, there must be a card

Since answer key concatenates all the digit, I will provide the index searching approach

```python
def get_first_number(card):
    idx = 0
    while get_card_size(card) > 0 and card[idx] != "-":
        i += 1
    return card[:idx]
```

This works because slicing empty string gives an empty string

## Part C Remove first number

Same thing but there is 2 while loops now, so we cannot slice (that uses 1 while loop only)

Due to restriction, forced to concatanate characters in the while loop.

1st while loop finds the index of hyphen then second while loop adds the rest of the characters

Refer to answer key for answer

## Part D check number

Note that the question explicitly mentions to not break abstraction. The usual way is to check each digits between the hyphen but we have already implemented get first and remove first

The idea is that we can read the first number then remove it to check the next number if it is not the desired tile

For efficiency sake, if the desired tile is found, just return True to stop the iterative loop

```python
def check_number(card, picked_tile):
    while len(card)!=0:
        num = get_first_number(card)
        if num == picked_tile:
            return True
        card = remove_first_number(card)
    return False
```

## Part E output of function


The function is attempting to assign specific character in string to the letter X. Since strings are immutable (cannot be assigned), it will raise a type error
