# Using this repo

Most of the items are in md format, for best experience, you can either view it on github or download and open it in notion/obsidian/vsc (cntrl+shift+v)/whatever that previews md file

# Contents

As of now, it's just pe1 

Don't really intend to add anything else aside from pe1+mid terms+pe2+finals because the rest are already covered in lect/tut/rect or you're supposed to do it on your own 

# Coding style

Just to clear any potential questions

## Conditional statements

If an if else is required for variable referencing, I often use ternary operators 

```python
var = 0 if <condition> else 1

# is also the same as

if <condition>:
	var = 0
else:
	var = 1
```

## Recursion 

I usually don't include an else in my code (unless I copied the ans key)

```python 
if <condition>:
	return fx(....)
return fx(...) 

# is also the same as 

if <condition>:
	return fx(...)
else:
	return fx(...)
```

## list comprehension 

I'll edit when the time comes
