# Using this repo

Most of the items are in md format, for best experience, open it in notion/obsidian/github (cntrl+shift+v)/whatever that previews md file

# Contents

As of now, it's just pe1 

Don't really intend to add anything else aside from pe1+mid terms+pe2+finals because the rest are already covered in lect/tut/rect or you're supposed to do it on your own 

# Issues/errors

Either msg me on telegram @chemcer or raise an issue
