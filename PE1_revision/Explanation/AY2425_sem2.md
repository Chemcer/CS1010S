# Q1A

## Script design

The function just wants to check if it is a mirror image at the center of the string

Have to create a function to check if 2 characters are mirror images to one another for simplicity sake

### Check if mirror image

Qn mentioned which alphabets to check so just brute force it and make sure account for permutations

<details>
<summary><b>Checking mirror image</b></summary>

```python
def is_equiv(a, b):
    if (a == "b") and (b == "d"):
        return True
    elif (a == "d") and (b == "b"):
        return True
    elif (a == "p") and (b == "q"):
        return True
    elif (a == "q") and (b == "p"):
        return True
    elif (a in "ilouvwx") and (b == a):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

</details>

## Final code

Entire idea is to check 1st and last --> 2nd and 2nd last-->... until we hit a certain length 

For efficiency sake, we stop the iterative loop the moment we know that one of the pairs isn't a mirror image

```python
def is_ambigram_iter(word):
    for i in range(len(word)):
        front = word[i]
        back = word[-i - 1]
        if not is_equiv(front, back):
            return False
    return True
```

</details>

Can definitely swap range(len(word)) at the index over the center

Don't need to be exact with the index, so it can be... 

```python 
length = len(word)
stop = length//2 + 1 # +1 to account for odd length strings
```

# Q1B

## Script design

Same as the qn above

Since we are checking the 1st and last, we should just repeat that then slice the string, s[1:-1]

## Final code

<details>
<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

```python
def is_ambigram_rec(word):
    if word == "":
        return True
    elif not is_equiv(word[0], word[-1]):
        return False
    else:
        return is_ambigram_rec(word[1:-1])
```
